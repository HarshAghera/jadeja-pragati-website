        The Scrap Battery Import License is a regulatory authorization that
        allows Indian importers to bring used or scrap lead-acid batteries from
        other countries. This license ensures that imports comply with
        environmental safety norms under the Batteries (Management and Handling)
        Rules and CPCB guidelines. It aims to promote proper recycling and
        prevent illegal dumping of hazardous materials.
