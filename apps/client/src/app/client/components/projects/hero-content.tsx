        A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a business structure that
        combines the flexibility of a partnership with the benefits of limited
        liability for its partners. It is a popular choice for startups,
        professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses looking for a
        cost-effective and legally compliant structure. An LLP ensures that each
        partnerâ€™s liability is limited to their agreed contribution, protecting
        personal assets while offering operational freedom.
